## OLIVE: Optimizing Linux-based Integrated Volumetrics and Economics

Consists of a user frontend run through a web browser, a Python codebase to compute data, and a SQL database backend to store output

Neat features include:
- Multiprocessing! Can run across as many cores as Jardine will give me
- Spiffy user interface with buttons (new feature in version 2!)
- Can apply normal, uniform, exponential, and binomial distributions
- Can autofit type curves within a specified range
- Can flex IP90 without impacting EUR
- Very efficient data connection to SQL Server
- Sophisticated natural language processing for economics
- Auto calculates percentiles for all output
- Overengineered paper trail, nothing is deleted
- Convenient use of CSVs to export and import data
